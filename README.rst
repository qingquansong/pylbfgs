This is a Python wrapper around Naoaki Okazaki (chokkan)'s liblbfgs_ library
of quasi-Newton optimization routines (limited memory BFGS and OWL-QN).

This package aims to provide a cleaner interface to the LBFGS
algorithm than is currently available in SciPy_, and to provide the
OWL-QN algorithm to Python users.

Part of the Dedupe.io_ cloud service and open source toolset for de-duplicating and finding fuzzy matches in your data.
